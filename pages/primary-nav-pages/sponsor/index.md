### Interested in Sponsoring a Meeting?

We welcome and encourage sponsors to adopt specific meetings. Sponsoring DC402 is a great way to give back to the community and foster growth of the group. Meeting sponsors may commit to picking up the tab at the end of the meeting. Alternately, a sponsor may elect to purchase a fixed food and/or drink menu, in which case details as to what is sponsored must be announced 2 weeks prior to the meeting. Sponsors may (but are not required to) open the meeting with remarks. Said remarks will be limited to less than 5 minutes timed with a comically large clock.
